The aim of the project was to employ data analysis tools (Python, pandas, scraping) to examine the evolution of rugby over different eras. In the first part, we will explore the evolution of the game itself and the developments in major rugby nations. In the second part, our focus will shift nation by nation.

The repository is composed of: 

- A csv file: The database of all official rugby matches between Argentina, Australia, England, France, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Scotland, South Africa and Wales since 1871. 
- A pdf file: The document the implementation and the details of the codes are not explained. For more information about the choices and the code please refer to the following document:  [Report](Final_report.pdf).
- An ipynb file: The Python notebook where all the analysis code has been written.
- Three html files: The maps of the professional rugby clubs in France.
