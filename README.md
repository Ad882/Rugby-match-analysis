The aim of the project was to employ data analysis tools (Python, pandas, scraping) to examine the evolution of rugby over different eras. In the first part, we will explore the evolution of the game itself and the developments in major rugby nations. In the second part, our focus will shift nation by nation.

The repository is composed of: 

- A csv file: The database of all official rugby matches between Argentina, Australia, England, France, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Scotland, South Africa and Wales since 1871. (⚠️ **Last update**: 15 of July 2023. ⚠️)
